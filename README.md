# BOUN CMPE250 Projects

These are the projects that I wrote for the Data Structures & Algorithms course in Boğaziçi University in Fall 2016. I got the highest grades in each project.

## Descriptions

1. BigInteger (using LinkedList)
2. Discrete Event Simulation
3. Shortest Path with Dependencies
4. Maximum Spanning Tree by Reverse Kruskal's Algorithm
5. A\* Search Algorithm

Detailed descriptions are in the pdf files in each project's directory.

## Test Cases

[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-XFTa1JgCvaUlNPWE1aQ0dkZWc)

* Public test cases were given us before due date to test our code.
* Private test cases were used for grading.

## Installation

Use _CMakeLists.txt_ files in each project's directory for compiling.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute.

## Distribution
